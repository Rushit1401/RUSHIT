            <h2>MS DHONI</h2>
            <p><b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> (born 7 July 1981) is an
                Indian professional cricketer who plays as a right-handed batter and a wicket-
                keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper batsmen and
                captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain 
                of the side in limited overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test 
                cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the most international 
                matches and is the most successful Indian captain. He has led India to 
                victory in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup,
                 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, being the only captain to win three different 
                 limited overs ICC tournaments. He also led the teams that won the Asia Cup in 2010,
                  2016 and was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.</p>
                  <br><p>Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999.
                     He made his debut for the Indian cricket team on 23 December 2004 in 
                     an ODI against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against
                      Sri Lanka. In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over 
                      in all formats by 2008. Dhoni retired from test cricket in 2014 but continued
                       playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored 17,266 runs in 
                       international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of more than 
                       50 in ODIs.</p>
                       <br><p>In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Dhoni plays for 
                        Chennai Super Kings (CSK), leading them to the final on ten 
                        occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023). 
                        He has also led CSK to two Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. 
                        Dhoni is amongst the few batsmen to have scored more than five thousand 
                        runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so</p>
                       <br><p>In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honor Major
                         Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by Government of India. He received the
                          fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third highest 
                          civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of 
                          Lieutenant colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial 
                          Army which was presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011.</p>
